# Podclip: MVP Idea & Business Model

## Product Overview
Podclip is an AI-powered podcast summarization app. It transforms long-form podcasts (1-2 hours) into concise 5-10 minute audio snippets, preserving original speaker voices and providing written summaries with AI-identified key topics. The content is strictly for personal use—no sharing functionality.

## Core MVP Features
1. **Podcast Summarization:** Upload or link a podcast episode (via RSS). Podclip generates a 5-10 minute audio summary in the original speakers' voices.
2. **Written Summary:** Each summary includes a written breakdown of key topics and main points, exportable to Notion.

## Business Model (MVP)
- **Monthly Subscription:** £5.99/month for 15 AI-generated episode summaries a month.
- **One-time Payment:** £29.99 for 45 summaries a month + transcripts.

## What is NOT in the MVP
- No sharing or social features
- No podcaster-facing dashboard (just a contact form for podcaster inquiries)
- No advanced analytics or integrations beyond Notion export
